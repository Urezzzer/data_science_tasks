There are five different data science tasks that were solved by me.
My goal was to get enough score to bring myself to the final not spending very much time.
So I spent 1 evening to figure out tasks. My solutions is not the best at all and can be improved. But I have achieved my goal!

* Classification of synthetic data - 6.51/10

It is very typical task, so I was not interested in this and used the easiest pipeline.
* Weather predicting - 8.83/10

I solved this task as classification task not using preferred methods (Gradient boosting and etc)
* Butterflies Classification - 8.96/10

I really like image classification, I have good pipeline to work with this, so I just used it to solve this task.
* Sentiment analysis of game reviews - 8/10

I used pretrained DistilBERT on SST-2-English. Would better to use [CLF]-Layer and classifier after this, I have such pipeline.
* Optimal sequence of acts - 9/10

It is my debute in reinforcement learning. I created Q-Learning algorithm myself. It was the most interesting task of the qualification.
